I have been working over implementing efficient fuzzy extractor implementation using BCH blocks of which I have uploaded the code here.
This is a custom library for microcontrolers like Arduino and ESP32.
This implementation is still incomplete so there will be some future updates soon for generalised BCH implementation, custom designing of fuzzy extractor using gui etc

The BCH(15, 7) implementation is completed and in BCH_general we implemented BCH(15*n, 7*n) as in to make it less complex for IoT implementation.
Next task will involve making file to make generator polynomial for general implementation.
